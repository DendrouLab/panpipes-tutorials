Ingesting multimodal (CITE-Seq + VDJ) datasets from cellranger outputs 
===================

Panpipes can read files from different cellranger outputs. Here we will showcase the example of  two multmodal (CITE-Seq + VDJ) datasets from the 10x website while ingesting cellranger multi outputs. 

Download **dataset 1 ( 10k human PBMCs)** from the [10x website](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/integrated-gex-totalseq-c-and-bcr-analysis-of-chromium-connect-generated-library-from-10k-human-pbmcs-2-standard)

Download **dataset 2 ( 5K human Tcells + CMV)** from the [10x website](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/integrated-gex-totalseqc-and-tcr-analysis-of-connect-generated-library-from-5k-cmv-t-cells-2-standard)
